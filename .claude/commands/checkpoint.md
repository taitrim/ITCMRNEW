# /checkpoint

Per-edit commit ritual. Use after EVERY focused change.

## Steps

1. Read `PROGRESS.md` — find the `🟡 in-progress` phase id (e.g. `M1-W2-P03`).
2. Read `commands.json` (project root or `.claude/commands.json`) — get `checkpoint` command for current preset.
3. Run the checkpoint command (typecheck + lint + test + build). MUST pass.
4. `git status` — list files changed.
5. `git add <specific files>` — never `git add -A` (avoids accidentally staging secrets / build output).
6. Generate commit message:
   - Subject: `wip(<phase-id>): <imperative verb> <what> [skip ci]` — ≤ 50 chars
     before the marker. The ` [skip ci]` suffix is MANDATORY on every wip commit:
     it still auto-pushes (death defense intact) but triggers NO Actions run, so
     per-edit commits cost zero CI minutes (private repos get 2,000 free/month).
   - Body (only if needed): why this change, not how.
7. `git commit -m "<message>"`.
8. `post-commit-push.js` hook auto-pushes to remote (non-blocking; commit stays local if push fails).
9. Report:
   ```
   COMMITTED: <hash> <message>
   PUSHED:    origin/<branch> | local-only (no remote / push failed)
   PHASE PROGRESS: <X of Y bullets done>
   NEXT: <next plan bullet>
   ```

## Refuse Conditions

- Checkpoint command failed → fix first, do not commit.
- `git diff --cached` empty → nothing to commit, abort.
- Files contain hardcoded secrets (post-edit hook should already block; double-check).
- No active phase in PROGRESS.md → ask user to start one first.

## Phase Completion

If this checkpoint completes the LAST bullet of the active phase:
1. Edit `PROGRESS.md` — mark phase `✅ done` + summary + this commit hash.
2. Run full verification one more time.
3. `git add PROGRESS.md && git commit -m "done(<phase-id>): <one-line summary>"`.
   NO `[skip ci]` on done commits — this is the one run that CI-verifies the
   whole phase.
4. Verify a CI run actually triggered: `gh run list --limit 1`. A docs-only done
   commit is skipped by the CI workflow's `paths-ignore` — then trigger manually
   (`gh workflow run "<CI workflow name>" --ref main`) and watch it green,
   otherwise the phase's wip code is never CI-verified.
5. Ask user: "phase done. Start next phase or pause?"
