# Progress Tracker

**Active phase:** `ITSM-P01` — ITSM core features (✅ done)
**Last update:** 2026-06-14 by setup script
**Last commit:** _none yet_
**Plan reference:** `AUDIT_AND_ROADMAP.md` (if exists) OR project README roadmap section.
**Model strategy:** see `AGENTS.md` → "Model & Tool Selection per Task" and `CLAUDE.md` §22. Every phase below MUST carry an explicit `Model:` line.

## Resume instructions for new Claude sessions

Read this in order on EVERY session start (after CLAUDE.md auto-loads):

1. Read **CLAUDE.md** (auto on session start) — pay attention to §13 resume protocol.
2. Read **THIS file** (`PROGRESS.md`).
3. Run `git log --oneline -20` — see recent commits including `wip:` markers from any dying session.
4. Run `git status` — see if any file is mid-edit (signal of dying-session death).
5. Find the phase marked `🟡 in-progress` below — that's where work continues.
6. Read its "Plan for this phase" sub-section + cross-reference with wip commits + uncommitted files.
7. Decide:
   - Uncommitted changes match the plan → finish in-flight edit, commit it.
   - Uncommitted changes don't match plan → likely garbage, `git checkout -- <file>` to discard.
   - No uncommitted changes → continue from next bullet in plan.
8. Run phase verification (`typecheck + build + test`) before doing more work.
9. Resume per the plan.

---

## Per-edit discipline (the only way to survive token-limit death)

**Assume the session can die after ANY tool call.** Every edit gets its own commit immediately. Never batch.

```
# Per-edit pattern:
1. Edit/Write ONE focused change.
2. Run: typecheck && build (verify compiles).
3. Run: git add <file> && git commit -m "wip(phase-id): brief desc".
```

At phase end:
1. Run all verification (typecheck + build + test).
2. Edit this file → mark phase `done` + summary + commit hash.
3. Commit: `done(phase-id): summary`.

If session dies mid-phase, NO MARK as done. Next session picks up exactly where stopped.

---

## Three-layer death defense (proactive, not reactive)

When the Claude session hits the token / usage limit, it **dies without warning** — no exit message, no closing commit, no summary. Whatever was about to happen in the next tool call simply does not happen. Defense must be proactive — assume death is possible after ANY tool call.

### Layer 1 — Intent on disk BEFORE action

At the START of every phase (not the end), the FIRST two tool calls are:

1. Edit this file → mark phase `🟡 in-progress` AND write its "Plan for this phase" block (explicit list of edits to make).
2. `git add PROGRESS.md && git commit -m "wip(<phase-id>): starting <brief>"`

If the session dies after step 2, the next session reads this file and sees both "what I was about to do" and a clean git state.

### Layer 2 — Commit + push after EVERY small edit (not at end of phase)

Each tool-call edit is its own checkpoint:

```bash
# Per-edit pattern (every meaningful change):
1. Edit one focused file/region.
2. typecheck && build   # verify still compiles
3. git add <file> && git commit -m "wip(<phase-id>): <brief>"
   # post-commit-push.js hook auto-pushes to remote.
```

Worst case if session dies mid-edit = ONE file half-modified. `git status` shows it. Next session reads the plan → either finishes that one edit or `git checkout -- <file>` and retries. `wip:` prefix makes it clear which commits are intermediate; squashing with `git rebase -i` at phase end is optional.

**Push is non-negotiable.** Local-only commits die with the disk. Remote push survives machine swap. The `post-commit-push.js` hook auto-runs after every successful commit. If push fails (offline / no remote / auth), commit stays local and the next successful push catches up — but be aware: if both disk AND offline window coincide, work IS lost. Configure a remote on day 1.

### Layer 3 — Phase completion is a SEPARATE final action

```bash
# Phase-completion sequence:
1. Run all verification (typecheck && build && test).
2. Edit this file → mark phase ✅ done + summary + last commit hash.
3. git add PROGRESS.md && git commit -m "done(<phase-id>): <summary>"
   # auto-pushed by post-commit-push.js hook
```

If the session dies BEFORE step 2, the phase stays `in-progress`. Next session reads the wip commits + runs verification → decides if work is actually complete and marks done.

### Anti-patterns to avoid

| Don't | Do |
|---|---|
| "I'll commit at the end of the phase" | Commit after every edit |
| "Let me make all the edits, then run tests" | Run typecheck + build after each edit, before commit |
| "I'll update the progress file when done" | Update progress file FIRST, commit it, THEN do work |
| Squash commits as you go (slow + risky) | Leave `wip:` commits, squash at phase end if time permits |
| Trust that "the AI will know to clean up" | Assume session dies after every tool call; plan accordingly |

### Optional safety net — auto-checkpoint cron

Belt+suspenders mode for the paranoid: a 5-minute cron / GitHub Actions workflow during active refactor windows:

```bash
# scripts/auto-checkpoint.sh
if [ -n "$(git status --porcelain)" ]; then
  git add -A
  git commit -m "auto-checkpoint: $(date -Iseconds)" --no-verify
fi
```

Trade-off: commits broken intermediate states. Easy to `git reset` later. Use only if the `wip:` commit discipline isn't enough on its own.

## What lives where

| File | Purpose | Updated when |
|---|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | AI agent root instructions. §13 = session-start protocol. | Once, at start of project |
| `PROGRESS.md` | Live state of all phases | After every phase status change |
| `AUDIT_AND_ROADMAP.md` (if exists) | Full plan — referenced by progress tracker | Rarely (only on plan revisions) |
| `audit-history/` (optional) | Frozen records of closed audits (e.g. `audit-history/2026-05-10-security.md`) | Never edit after closing |
| `git log` | Commit hashes per phase | Every commit |

### Audit-history convention

When an audit is fully closed (all findings resolved), move it to `audit-history/YYYY-MM-DD-<scope>.md`. Frozen — never edit after move. New audits start fresh from `AUDIT_AND_ROADMAP.template.md`. Keeps history queryable without polluting active plan.

---

## Stopping criteria (when it's safe to pause)

Acceptable pauses:
- End of any phase (clean break, all tests green).
- End of any week.

Do NOT pause:
- Mid-phase (commit + resume notes first).
- Mid-migration (always finish + verify a migration in one session).

---

## Owner check-in cadence (non-coder friendly)

Every Friday:
1. Read week's `PROGRESS.md` updates.
2. Click through the live app — does anything feel different?
3. Run `npm test` (or preset equivalent) locally — all green?
4. Check latest commits — anything surprising?
5. If anything unclear, ask the AI to explain in plain English (reference `docs/HANDOVER.md` glossary).
